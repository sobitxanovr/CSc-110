    Takes a given mine csv file and converts it to a 2D list.
    The 2D list that this returns will have one-character strings.
    An 'X' will represent a mine, and a ' ' is a non-mine.
    For example, this function might return a 2D list that liiks like:

    [ [' ', 'X', ' '],
      ['X', ' ', ' '],
      [' ', ' ', 'X'] ]

    Parameters:
    filename:   The name of a csv file to be read.
